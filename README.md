# P-TOP
Converts Python scripts To OCR 'friendly' Pseudcode 

# What?
Feed me a Python script. Using various magic, it will create a second .py file containing pseudocode for said file.

# Why?
Why not?

# What am I not? 
A way to easily skip a vital component of GCSE/A-level software design. Always do your own pseudocode in the first instance and use this program as a way of checking the accuracy. 

# "It doesn't work"
Make sure you pointed the script at your program (line 3, pythonFile var) - you might need the full dir
