Converts Python scripts to OCR 'friendly' pseudcode 

# What?
Feed me a Python script, I will birth you the pseudcode for it

# Why?
Why not?

# What am I not? 
A way to easily skip a vital component of GCSE/A-level software design. Always do your own pseudocode in the first instance and use this program as a way of checking the accuracy. 

# "It doesn't work"
