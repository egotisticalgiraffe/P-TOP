def indentationFinder(svgfile, linesToAvoid):
    """
        This function traces through the entire file tracing indentation to find where structures start and end.
        The protocol for the lists is as follows
        [WordSearchingFor, WordReplaceWith, EmptyList, EmptyList, AddANewLineAfter?]
        The 2 emtpy lists are used to store the location and line number of where the items are found, which is passed onto the replacing function
        A basic description of what is going on
            We define the list of lists, searchFor which holds the stuff we are going to look for.
            We then, using a for loop iterate through every line.
            Inside that loop we have a second for loop which iterates through all the objects in searchFor.
            Basically we are checking to see if any of the words are on the current line, 1 word at a time from searchFor.
            If we find a word and it isn't a line we are meant to be avoiding (maybe it has a multiline comment?) we move down
                We assign distance to how many characters in from the left the found word was, this will be the level in we are tracing with.
                The program then searches each line that follows to see if it can find any character to the left (or equal) to distance on its current line.
                If it finds and first character is else, # or ~~~ it ignores those lines.
                If it isn't any of those special characters that has been found first, we can assume this structure has finished as it has unindentected.
                    We write the line number and how far in the structure started to the 2 empty lists inside the sublist.
            Finally we return the searchFor list, hopefully with lots of line numbers and indentation distances.
